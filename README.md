# FCC AUTHOR'S PAGE

## One common aspect of web development is learning how to fetch data from an external API, then work with asynchronous JavaScript.

## This freeCodeCamp authors page project shows how to use the fetch method, then dynamically update the DOM to display the fetched data.

## This project will also teach how to paginate data in order to load results in batches.
